To start the server, stand in this directory and run

    evennia start

This will start the server, logging output to the console. Make
sure to create a superuser when asked. By default you can now connect
to your new game using a MUD client on `localhost`, port `4000`.  You can
also log into the web client by pointing a browser to
`http://localhost:4001`.
